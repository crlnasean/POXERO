# POXERO

POXERO is a cross-platform desktop utility for macOS and Windows that makes computers feel faster and more responsive by prioritizing the active task, safely managing background apps, and helping users instantly recover from unresponsive applications.

Unlike traditional “system optimizer” tools, POXERO is honest, transparent, and fully compliant with operating system security models. It does not fake performance gains or manipulate memory in unsafe ways.

## Why POXERO Exists

Modern computers are powerful, but users still experience:
- Lag when switching between apps
- Background apps consuming resources unnoticed
- Frozen or unresponsive applications
- Overly complex task managers that overwhelm non-technical users

POXERO solves these problems with a **simple, focused interface** and **clear user actions**.
